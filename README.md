# A collaborative recreation of printf in C
This project is a collaborative attempt to learn how major parts of the "printf" function work in C, and re-implement them. 

"printf" takes arbitrarily long input and uses format specifiers to display the data. So our implementation "_printf", uses a variadic function for this.
